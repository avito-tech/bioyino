# This schema defines a way to deliver metrics in both ways:
# as pre-aggregated shapshots and as new metrics
# Please note, that capnproto allows to skip sending any fields
# if they are separate types, so  there is almost no need to integrate
# option-like type into schema type system.
# Bio will try to accept unspecified fields with some defaults,
# but may fail if it cannot get ones it needs

# the difference between snapshot and multi is that snapshot will be sent
# only to backend not to other nodes in the network
